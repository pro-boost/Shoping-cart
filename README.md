# Online Shop Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Online Shop Project! This application is designed to simulate an e-commerce experience using React. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of React, component structure, state management, and user interactions through a fully functional shopping cart.

## Features

- **Homepage**: A welcoming interface with images and general information about the shop.
- **Shop Page**: Displays a list of products fetched from the FakeStore API, complete with product titles, images, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and see a real-time update of their cart total.
- **Navigation Bar**: A consistent navigation bar is present on both pages, showing the number of items in the cart and providing easy access to the checkout page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **React Router**: For navigation between the home and shop pages.
- **CSS Modules**: For modular and scoped styling.
- **FakeStore API**: To fetch product data dynamically.
- **React Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing of components.
